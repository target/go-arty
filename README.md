go-arty is a Go client library for accessing the [Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Artifactory+REST+API) and [Xray](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/XRAY/Xray+REST+API) API.


## Artifactory

### Usage

```go
import "github.com/target/go-arty/artifactory"
```

Construct a new Artifactory client, then use the various services on the client to access different parts of the Artifactory API. For example:

```go
client, _ := artifactory.NewClient("artifactory.company.com", nil)

// list all users from the artifactory server
users, _, err := client.Users.GetAll()
```

### Authentication

The `artifactory` package allows you to pass basic auth or an [API Key](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Updating+Your+Profile#UpdatingYourProfile-APIKey).

Example using basic auth:

```go
client, _ := artifactory.NewClient("artifactory.company.com", nil)

client.Authentication.SetBasicAuth("username", "password")
```

Example using API Key:

```go
client, _ := artifactory.NewClient("artifactory.company.com", nil)

client.Authentication.SetTokenAuth("token")
```

## Xray

### Usage

```go
import "github.com/target/go-arty/xray"
```

Construct a new Xray client, then use the various services on the client to access different parts of the Xray API. For example:

```go
client, _ := xray.NewClient("artifactory.company.com", nil)

// list all users from the xray server
users, _, err := client.Users.GetAll()
```

### Authentication

The `xray` package allows you to pass basic auth or a [token](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/XRAY/Xray+REST+API#XrayRESTAPI-Authentication).

**NOTE: To get the token for Xray, you have to hit an API endpoint that returns the token. See [the docs for more info](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/XRAY/Xray+REST+API#XrayRESTAPI-GetToken).**

Example using basic auth:

```go
client, _ := xray.NewClient("xray.company.com", nil)

client.Authentication.SetBasicAuth("username", "password")
```

Example using token:

```go
client, _ := xray.NewClient("xray.company.com", nil)

client.Authentication.SetTokenAuth("token")
```

## Versioning

In general, `go-arty` follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) as closely as we can for tagging releases of the package. For self-contained libraries, the application of semantic versioning is relatively straightforward and generally understood. But because `go-arty` is a client library for the Artifactory API and the Xray API, which both change behavior frequently, we've adopted the following versioning policy:

* We increment the major version with any incompatible change to either package (`artifactory` or `xray`) in this library, including changes to the exported Go API surface or behavior of the API.
* We increment the minor version with any backwards-compatible changes to functionality.
* We increment the patch version with any backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## Road map

This library was initially developed for internal applications at Target, so API methods will likely be added in the order that they are required.
